      Rebooting your server while a ISO image is mounted will cause it to boot from the image.

    Logged in as root and ran `reboot`

  * Prompted for root password after server rebooted, didn't have it
  * Unmounted ISO and power cycled using web ui
  * Logged in as root and used `passwd` to change password
  * Re-mounted ISO
  * Logged in as root and ran `reboot`
  * Prompted for root password after server rebooted and system did not accept the new root password
  * Asked #NixOS for help, they suggested looking at the kvm instead.
